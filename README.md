Xmal an interpretable Android malware classifier
=========================================================

What is Xmal?
---------------
Xmal is a novel and interpretable ML-based approach to classify malware with
high accuracy and explain the classification result meanwhile. It allows users
to identify the malware as well as point out the malicious behavior. You can 
understand why an Android application is classified as malware, thus you can 
directly generate an analysis report of the malware or you can further analyse
the malware accordingly. 

How do I get started with Xmal?
---------------------------------
We have some documentation on Xmal in our [_**wiki**_](https://github.com/wubozhi/xmal/wiki). You probably would like to read 
this README first and then have a look on Xmal's project directory and paper(https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11516) as well.
